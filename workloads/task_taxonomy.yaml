# SSH Backend Benchmark Task Taxonomy
# Each category is designed to expose specific differences

task_categories:
  # Category 1: Connection Performance
  # Measures: Initial connection time, reuse efficiency, parallel connections
  connection_performance:
    - connection_establishment
    - connection_reuse
    - parallel_connections
    - connection_teardown
  
  # Category 2: Data Transfer
  # Measures: Small/large file performance, streaming efficiency
  data_transfer:
    - small_payloads
    - medium_payloads
    - large_payloads
    - streaming_transfers
  
  # Category 3: Computation Tasks
  # Measures: CPU-bound vs IO-bound performance
  computation:
    - cpu_intensive
    - memory_intensive
    - mixed_workload
  
  # Category 4: Real-world Operations
  # Measures: Common DevOps tasks performance
  realworld_ops:
    - file_operations
    - process_management
    - service_control
    - configuration_management
  
  # Category 5: Error & Recovery
  # Measures: Error handling, reconnection behavior
  error_recovery:
    - connection_drops
    - timeout_handling
    - retry_behavior

# Expected Performance Differences by Category
expected_differences:
  connection_performance:
    controlpersist: "Better connection reuse, lower latency after first connection"
    paramiko: "Consistent connection time, no reuse benefits"
  
  data_transfer:
    controlpersist: "Better large file throughput, connection reuse helps"
    paramiko: "Potential overhead in data serialization"
  
  computation:
    controlpersist: "Minimal overhead, native execution"
    paramiko: "Python layer overhead in command execution"
  
  realworld_ops:
    controlpersist: "Better for repetitive tasks due to connection reuse"
    paramiko: "More consistent across varied operations"
  
  error_recovery:
    controlpersist: "Better at maintaining persistent connections"
    paramiko: "Better error messages and debugging"
